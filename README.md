node js, express, mongodb, reactjs needed

Node.js: asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
Express: server-side web framework, and node.js the popular and powerful JavaScript server platform.
MongoDB: built on JSON and JavaScript, used to store JSON data natively
React: frontend JavaScript framework for building interactive user interfaces in HTML, and communicating with a remote server.

#For backend,


1. Moment: used for parsing, validating, manipulating, and displaying dates and times in JavaScript.
2. Body-parser: node.js body parsing middleware to parse incoming requests
3. Cors: for cross origin requests, uses additional HTTP headers to tell browsers to give a web application running at one origin, access to selected resources from a different origin.
4. Mongoose: JavaScript library that allows you to define schemas with strongly typed data
5. Dotenv: zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a.env file into process.env. 
6. Nodemon: utility that will monitor for any changes in your source and automatically restart your server.


#For Frontend,

1. Axios: tool to make Ajax requests to our back-end from our front-end
2. React-file-base64: react component to convert the files (images) being uploaded by the user.
3. React-dom:  package provides DOM-specific methods.
4. React-redux: official react binding for redux to let the React components read data from a Redux store, and dispatch actions to the store to update data.
5. Redux-thunk: for asynchronous actions using redux, it is a middleware to write action creators that return a function instead of an action.
6. material-ui/core: React component for faster and easier web dev design system
